<ul>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/cc-concept.json"><strong>Capability
Contract: Concepts</strong></a><br />
Concepts found in an interview about diabetes. A concept document
contains objects and series objects of type ‘concept’. This document
contains a summary of all concepts found in a transcription, as well as
a series with the concepts found at each time-stamp. This example uses
eContext library of concepts, but there are many other libraries as
well, like IAB’s Content Taxonomy or IPTC’s Media Topics.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/cc-entity.json"><strong>Capability
Contract: Entity</strong></a><br />
Entities found in a text message. An entity document contains objects of
type ‘namedEntity’. Entity extraction engines classify named entities,
located in unstructured text, into predefined categories such as People,
Organizations, or Locations.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/cc-keyword.json"><strong>Capability
Contract: Keyword</strong></a><br />
Keywwords and descriptions extracted from a description of a person. A
keyword document contains objects of type ‘keyword’. Keyword extraction
engines find and extract significant words or phrases from a text, which
can be used for indexing, searching, or summarizing content.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/cc-language.json"><strong>Capability
Contract: Language</strong></a><br />
The language detected in a document or media file. The only required
information is the ‘language’ at the root, which must be an ISO-639-1
language code. This document also includes an optional list of other
languages checked, along with their confidence scores.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/cc-mediatranslated.json"><strong>Capability
Contract: Media-translated</strong></a><br />
Translations of full media files. When media is translated, the
translation may be attached to TDOs (temporal data objects) as asset
documents. The engine stores references to these translation assets in a
‘media’ list, which identifies the language of each document. In this
example, literal translations are also stored as optional ‘text’
objects, which makes this document also fulfill the Text Capability
Contract.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/cc-object.json"><strong>Capability
Contract: Objects</strong></a><br />
Objects identified in a image. An object document only contains objects
of type ‘object’. Object detection engines identify various objects in
images or video and label their position and attributes. Object
detection engines are the most common engine types, and the ‘object’
contract is the most general contract for storing any generic object.
There are also more specific object types such as ‘face’,
‘motorVehicle’, ‘logo’, ‘barcode’ that may be more appropriate for
specific use cases.</li>
<li><a
href="./aion/examples/cc-sentiment_emotions.json"><strong>Capability
Contract: Sentiment (emotions)</strong></a><br />
Detecting emotions on a face. Emotion analysis engines analyze context
or images to determine the emotions portrayed. In this document, a
single face is analyzed and the confidence levels for each emotion are
provided.</li>
<li><a
href="./aion/examples/cc-sentiment_sentiments.json"><strong>Capability
Contract: Sentiment (sentiments)</strong></a><br />
Sentiment detected in a brief review. Sentiment analysis engines analyze
text to determine the emotional tone behind it, classifying it as
positive, negative, or neutral. Multiple sentiments may be detected in
the same phrase or document with varying confidence levels.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/cc-summary.json"><strong>Capability
Contract: Summary</strong></a><br />
Summary of textual documents. This example contains a summary of a text
discussing the development of spider silk in an industrial context.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/cc-text_ocr.json"><strong>Capability
Contract: Text (OCR)</strong></a><br />
Text read from an image. This example demonstrates the output of OCR on
a low-resolution news video.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/cc-text_text.json"><strong>Capability
Contract: Text (text)</strong></a><br />
Text extracted or generated from a document or media file. There are
many engine types that generate ‘text’ objects: translations, OCR, and
text extraction (there is a separate contract for transcriptions,
though). This document contains text translated to Welsh, but any engine
that extracts or generates text from an input file can use this
contract.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/cc-transcript.json"><strong>Capability
Contract: Transcript</strong></a><br />
Transcription of audio documents. This example contains a transcript of
a video about spider silk. Transcript contracts may also be used for
translations of spoken language as well.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/empty.json"><strong>Empty
Object</strong></a><br />
An empty object is a valid AION file</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/oc-concept.json"><strong>Object Contract:
Concept</strong></a><br />
Concept objects may be for specific text phrases, or a list of concepts
found across the entire document. Concept objects MUST include ‘text’
and/or ‘objectCategory’ properties.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/oc-face.json"><strong>Object Contract:
Face</strong></a><br />
Face object with many supporting fields. Objects of type ‘face’ MUST
include a ‘boundingPoly’, SHOULD include ‘label’, ‘confidence’, and MAY
include select other fields related to facial features.</li>
<li><a
href="./aion/examples/oc-fingerprint_tracked-object.json"><strong>Object
Contract: Fingerprint (tracking)</strong></a><br />
Fingerprint object used to identify a unique object (person, vehicle,
etc.) in a video stream. This fingerprint may also be used to track the
object between different videos. These fingerprints MUST include a 256-,
512-, or 1024-dimensional fingerprintVector, referenceId, label, and
tags, and MAY include some other properties.</li>
<li><a
href="./aion/examples/oc-fingerprint_watermark.json"><strong>Object
Contract: Fingerprint (watermark)</strong></a><br />
Fingerprint object used to identify unique audio or video content. A
fingerprint for watermarked content MUST include a ‘label’ (the unique
fingerprint) and ‘text’.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/oc-licenseplate.json"><strong>Object
Contract: License plate</strong></a><br />
This document describes the license plate of the Dukes of Hazzard’s
General Lee. A license plate object MUST include ‘licensePlate’
property, and MAY include some other properties. If the license plate is
detected attached to an identifiable vehicle, then ‘motorVehicle’ type
should be used instead.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/oc-logo.json"><strong>Object Contract:
Logo</strong></a><br />
This document describes the logos found in a test document. A logo
object MUST include ‘label’, ‘confidence’ and ‘boundingPoly’, and MAY
include some other properties.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/oc-motorvehicle.json"><strong>Object
Contract: Motor vehicle</strong></a><br />
This document describes the Dukes of Hazzard’s General Lee with the
optional license plate. A motor vehicle MUST include ‘motorVehicle’
property with at least one identifying property in it, and MAY include
other properties.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/oc-namedentity.json"><strong>Object
Contract: Named Entity</strong></a><br />
Named entity objects refer to specific entities (individuals, locations,
times, organizations, etc) in a document along with an identifying
category for that entity. Named entities MUST include a ‘label’ for the
entity and an ‘objectCategory’ for the identification, and MAY include
some other properties.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/oc-object.json"><strong>Object Contract:
Object</strong></a><br />
Object detection is the process of identifying objects within an image
or video. Objects are the most general type of visual entity
identification, and should be used only when more specific types (like
‘face’ or ‘licensePlate’) are not applicable. Objects SHOULD have a
‘boundingPoly’ and a ‘confidence’</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/oc-ocr.json"><strong>Object Contract: OCR
(Optical Character Recognition)</strong></a><br />
OCR is the extraction of text from images or video frames. OCR objects
are a specialization of ‘text’ objects that include bounding polygons
for the text. OCR objects MUST include ‘text’ and ‘boundingPoly’, and
MAY include some other properties.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/oc-sound.json"><strong>Object Contract:
Sound</strong></a><br />
Sound identification may include music, sound effects, other audio
content like silence or static. Sound objects MUST include a ‘label’,
SHOULD include ‘confidence’, and MAY include some other properties.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/oc-speaker.json"><strong>Object Contract:
Speaker</strong></a><br />
Speaker identification processes audio files and identifies individual
speakers. The speaker object MUST include a ‘label’ to identify the
speaker. The object MAY include some other properties as well.
Typically, the speakers are identified within the context of one audio
file, and are labeled something like ‘Speaker 1’ and ‘Speaker 2’ or
simply ‘A’ and ‘B’, but if an external reference is available, the
speaker may be identified by name or entityId.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/oc-text_extraction.json"><strong>Object
Contract: Text (extraction)</strong></a><br />
Text objects may refer to text extracted from a file, like in the case
of OCR (optical character recognition).</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/oc-text_generation.json"><strong>Object
Contract: Text (generation)</strong></a><br />
Text objects may store generated text like this output from an input
document containing ‘Provide a three sentence summary of The
Hobbit’</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/oc-text_sentiment.json"><strong>Object
Contract: Text (analysis)</strong></a><br />
Text objects may refer to text accompanied by an analysis of deeper
meaning, like sentiment, intent, or emotional tone.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/oc-text_transcription.json"><strong>Object
Contract: Text (transcription)</strong></a><br />
Text objects may contain transcriptions of spoken recordings. Note that
the ‘transcript’ Capability Contract requires word-by-word
transcription, whereas a transcription stored in ‘text’ may be more
generalized.</li>
<li><a href="./aion/examples/oc-text_translation.json"><strong>Object
Contract: Text (translation)</strong></a><br />
Text objects may refer to text translated from another file, like in the
case of translation of a Memo from German to English.</li>
