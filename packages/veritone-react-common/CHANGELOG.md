## 1.1.0

* Adds AppContainer component â€” can be used as the central content container in an app that uses AppBar, TopBar, AppFooter, and/or a sidebar. See the associated story.

* FilePicker
  * add human-readable name for "image/*" accept type

## 3.0.0
* Replaced webpack with rollup
  * The bundle is now an es module rather than UMD, which should enable tree shaking to a greater extent, reducing the filesize overhead of using the library.
  * Dependencies are now external to the library rather than being included in the bundle. Because of this, bundle size is reduced significantly. 
  * A commonJS bundle is also included for older toolchains that do not understand the es module format.

* Remove normalize.css to avoid polluting global styles.

* AppBar
  * update Veritone logo

## 4.0.0
* AppBar
  * Added props.logoSrc (string), which allows a logo to be passed into the component.
  * (breaking) Added props.onSwitchApp (func), which replaces the original behavior of setting window.location to the app immediately.

## 4.1.0
* The CJS bundle is now transpiled to >0.5% in babel-preset-env (compared to >5% previously), for wider compatibility with old browsers and tools. 

## 4.2.0
