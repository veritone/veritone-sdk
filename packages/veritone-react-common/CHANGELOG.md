## 1.1.0

* Adds FilePicker and ProgressDialog components to veritone-react-common. These are only meant to be used via the widgets in `veritone-widgets`.
* Adds AppContainer component — can be used as the central content container in an app that uses AppBar, TopBar, AppFooter, and/or a sidebar. See the associated story.

## 2.0.0

  * fixes "Cannot have two HTML5 backends" issue
  * (breaking) The filepicker now supports single-file mode and uses it by default. Set `multiple: true` to allow multi file upload

## 2.1.0

  * removes a rogue period from the component

* FilePicker
  * add human-readable name for "image/\*" accept type

## 3.0.0

* Replaced webpack with rollup

  * The bundle is now an es module rather than UMD, which should enable tree shaking to a greater extent, reducing the filesize overhead of using the library.
  * Dependencies are now external to the library rather than being included in the bundle. Because of this, bundle size is reduced significantly.
  * A commonJS bundle is also included for older toolchains that do not understand the es module format.

* Remove normalize.css to avoid polluting global styles.

* AppBar
  * update Veritone logo

## 4.0.0

* AppBar

  * (breaking) Added props.onSwitchApp (func), which replaces the original behavior of setting window.location to the app immediately.

## 4.1.0
